1. Structure the markdown content using clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and tables where necessary.
2. Emphasize key points with bold and italic formatting.
3. Use code blocks for technical content or specific formatting instructions.
4. Ensure that links and images are included when relevant, in proper markdown format.
5. Generate only markdown text without rendering any HTML.

The generated markdown must be suitable for conversion into a user-friendly document layout on the UI. Provide content that is concise, informative, and visually organized. Ensure the output is always in a valid markdown syntax without errors.`;
